<h1>3VO Standards against child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE)</h1>
<small>Last modified date: 20/01/2025</small>

  <div class="embed-privacy">
    <p><strong>Child safety</strong></p>
    <p><strong>January 2025</strong></p>
    <p><strong>We have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation and remove certain media depicting
        physical child abuse to prevent the normalization of violence against children.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Our Child Safety policy is designed to protect minors from sexual and physical abuse, as well as psychological
        harm that may resolt from sharing such content. With this principle in mind, Child Safety content is any content
        that contains Child Sexual Exploitation, Physical Child Abuse Media and Media of Minors in Physical Altercation,
        as defined below. </p>
    <p>We encourage our users to come to 3VO.ME to share stories, raise awareness, and speak their mind - including
        calling attention to the exploitation of children and minors. However, even when shared with the intent to bring
        awareness or justice, to express outrage or sharing content in a humoristic context, posting media of children
        experiencing sexual abuse or certain types of physical abuse can contribute to their revictimization and may
        even lead to the normalization of sexual or physical violence against children. When this content is shared on
        3VO.ME, we may remove it even if it was shared with good intent. Our priority is to protect minors from
        physical and psychological harm irrespective of the context in which the content may be shared.</p>
    <p>We use the terms children and minors interchangeably in any of our policies and define them as any person under
        the age of 18.</p>
    <p><strong>Child Sexual Exploitation</strong></p>
    <p>3VO.ME has zero tolerance towards any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation. This may
        include real media, text, illustrated, or computer-generated media - including generative AI media. Regardless
        of the intent, anyone viewing, sharing, linking, or engaging with any kind of child sexual exploitation material
        contributes to the re-victimization of the depicted children and puts children at an extreme risk of being
        harmed. This also applies to content that may further contribute to victimization of children through the
        promotion or glorification of child sexual exploitation.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Not allowed</strong></p>
    <p>Any content that depicts or promotes child sexual exploitation is strictly prohibited on 3VO.ME. This includes,
        but is not limited to, directly or indirectly sharing, requesting, linking to, engaging with (such as liking or
        reposting, or following accounts that distribute), expressing a desire for, or describing:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>depictions of a child engaging in sexually explicit or suggestive acts, which may include edits of such
            media, such as obscuring faces or body parts;
        </li>
        <li>sexualized commentaries about or directed at a known (or unknown) minor;
        </li>
        <li>links to third-party sites that host child sexual exploitation materials of any kind;
        </li>
        <li>fantasies about or promoting engagement in child sexual exploitation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Additionally, we prohibit any of the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>identifying alleged victims of childhood sexual exploitation by name or image;</li>
        <li>promoting or normalizing sexual attraction to minors as a form of identity or sexual orientation;
        </li>
        <li>sending sexually explicit media to a child, or engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit
            conversation;
        </li>
        <li>trying to obtain sexually explicit media from a child, or trying to engage a child in sexual activity
            through blackmail or other incentives;
        </li>
        <li>recruiting, advertising or expressing an interest in a commercial sex act involving a child, or in harboring
            and/or transporting a child for sexual purposes;
        </li>
        <li>threatening to share, or requesting that others share sexual media of minors, including self-generated
            sexual media of minors, particolarly when engaging in blackmail or bounty tactics.
        </li>
    </ol>


    <p><strong>Allowed </strong></p>
    <p>We will make very limited exceptions to content related to child sexual exploitation only where there is a low
        risk of direct harm to the minor(s): </p>
    <ol>
        <li>discussion related to child sexual exploitation that does not promote or glorify child sexual exploitation
            in any way or identify the potential victim;
        </li>
        <li>victims sharing their stories, provided they do not contain explicit details or media;
        </li>
        <li>conversations about help-seeking behavior of individuals who may struggle with an attraction to minors;
        </li>
        <li>advocacy against illegal or harmfol activity involving minors, provided there is no sharing of, or linking
            to any material featuring child sexual exploitation.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>

    <p><strong>For violations of our Child Sexual Exploitation policy:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>in the majority of cases, users will be immediately and permanently suspended;
        </li>
        <li>additionally, when weâ€™re made aware of content depicting or promoting child sexual exploitation, including
            links to third party sites where this content can be accessed, the accounts sharing this content will be
            reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC);
        </li>
        <li>for certain violations, we may instead require post removal. For example, we may ask someone to remove the
            violating content. Subsequent violations may lead to account suspension.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Physical Child Abuse Media</strong></p>
    <p>To prevent the revictimization or normalization of violence against children, we will remove most instances of
        media depicting physical child abuse, even if shared to raise awareness or express outrage.
    </p>
    <p>When assessing the best course of action to take, we consider:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>whether the child is nude, partially clothed, or folly clothed;</li>
        <li>the severity of harm the child is experiencing;</li>
        <li>whether the media was shared with abusive, non-abusive, or newsworthy context.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Not allowed</strong></p>
    <p>With the above criteria in mind, we are more likely to remove any media:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>where the child is nude and experiencing any type of harm;</li>
        <li>shared with abusive context;</li>
        <li>where the child is experiencing moderate or major harm.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Restricted reach</strong></p>
    <p>We will make limited exceptions to media depicting physical child abuse in certain circumstances, such as:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>when the media is being shared to identify the child in order to rescue them from the abusive situation, or
            identify the perpetrator;
        </li>
        <li>when the media is being shared by news organizations.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If we decide to allow this media on the platform, we will require it to be placed behind our Graphic Content
        warning.
    </p>

    <p><strong>For violations of our Physical Child Abuse Media policy, we may:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the content less visible on 3VO.ME by:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>applying a content warning;</li>
            <li>requiring post removal. For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and serve a
                period of time in read-only mode before they can post again. Subsequent violations may lead to account
                suspension.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <li>Suspend accounts whose sole purpose appears to be to engage in the types of behavior prohibited above.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Media of Minors in Physical Altercation</strong></p>
    <p>We aim to protect the wellbeing of minors involved in physical altercation, regardless of their status (i.e
        victim or aggressor), while balancing the need to raise awareness of these issues. When assessing the best
        course of action to take, we may consider whether:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>the content is shared with an abusive or non-abusive context;</li>
        <li>we have received a report from the minor or an authorized representative;</li>
        <li>the content is excessively graphic.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Restricted reach</p>
    <ol>
        <li>We will make limited exceptions to media depicting children in physical altercation in certain
            circumstances, such as when the media is being shared by news organizations. If we decide to allow this
            media on the platform, we may require it to be placed behind a content warning.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>For violations of our Media of Minors is Physical Altercation policy:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>We may require post removal upon receiving a report from the minor or an authorized representative. For
            example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode
            before they can post again. Subsequent violations may lead to account suspension.
        </li>
    </ol>
